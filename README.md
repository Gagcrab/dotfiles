# The Suz Special - Michael's dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repo, currently including configs for:
- My high-power desktop with openSUSE Tumbleweed (cubepoot)
- My ancient GNU Guix System laptop (x550cc)
- My current work/uni laptop using openSUSE Tumbelweed under WSL2 (wsl)

Emacs and vim configs are included as submodules.

Use GNU Stow to link the desired folders to $HOME.
